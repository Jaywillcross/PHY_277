# PHY_277
Public repository for the code written for the course PHY 277: Computation for Physics and Astronomy. The goal of the class is to teach Fortran 2008 and C++ 2011 as well as basic Linux navigation and LateX typesetting. 

Each HW has a corresponding assignment sheet. Submission for each homework is just `james_cross_hw_[number].f08`, so other files in those folders were written to test parts for the actual submission.
